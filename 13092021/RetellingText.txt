How not to die before you get old.

Chiako is active and healthy. She gets up at 7am every day, takes a brisk 30-minute walk and plays gate-ball with her friends three times a week. There is nothing unusual about this, except that Chiako is 102 years old. She is not alone - there are hundreds of healthy centenarians who lead similar lives in Okinawa.
Okinawa is a group of islands between Japan and Taiwan. Near a beach, there is a large stone with the following words on it: 'At 70 you are still a child, at 80 you are just a youth, and at 90, if the ancestors
invite you into heaven, ask them to wait until you are 100, and then
you might consider it.'
Okinawans manage to stay slim in old age by eating a low-calorie diet which consists of three quarters plant food and one quarter animal food. They eat seven servings of fruit and vegetables every day and they stop eating when they are 80% full.
They also keep active by dancing, walking and gardening. In other words, they do the things they enjoy.
Okinawans have developed a stress-resistant personality. Nobody is
in a hurry, timetables are non-existent and there is always tomorrow.
Hundreds of people, both young and old, go to the beach every day to watch the spectacular sunsets. In Okinawa there is always time to watch the sun set.
As well as large extended families, Okinawans have strong networks of friends. 'When someone is ill and doesn't come to work, a neighbour will always knock on their door to find out how they are."
There's no magic pill. If you have good friends, a healthy diet and a stress-free lifestyle, you will live longer. It's as simple as that!
